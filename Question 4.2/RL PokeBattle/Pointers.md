# Directions for the RL Assignment (Q 4.2.3)

## Mandatory:
- Define a State Space for the environment
- Define a reward function for the environment

**Note: only move on to the additions after you've got a basic agent working on the env**

## Easy additions:
- Design an Opponent AI: The more the intelligent, the better
- Add more Moves to `moves.csv`
- Add more Pokemon to `stats.csv`

## Medium additions:
- Consider more stats like Att., Def., Sp.Att. etc
- Introduce Status effects
- Implement complex moves like multi-step moves (Hyper Beam, Solar Beam etc) and status-inducing moves (Will-o-Wisp, Hypnosis etc)
- Manage PP (power points for attacks)

## Hard additions:
- Implement a Multi-Agent system. (This is NOT recommended for beginners but will be highly rewarded)
